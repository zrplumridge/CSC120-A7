# CSC120-A7: Not Your Parent's Method

## Outline
In this assignment (Part II of a two-week assignment), we'll dive a little deeper into how to use [**Inheritance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) and [**Method Overriding**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_overriding) / [**Overloading**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) to write _parsimonious_ programs. 

We'll start with an expanded version of our class representing a generic `Building` (`Building.java`):

On top of its previous functionality, our `Building` class now has several useful new features:
 - Overloaded constructors, adding some flexibility about how `Building`s are constructed
 - Various methods for interacting with the building (e.g. `enter()`, `exit()`, `goUp()`, `goDown()`, and `goToFloor(int n)`).
 - A handy `showOptions()` method to tell the user what options are available
 - A few additional class attributes (feel free to explore) 
 
## Phase 0: Swapping Out `Building.java`
First things first: replace the original `Building` class from [A6: Use What Your Parent (Class) Gave You](https://github.com/jcrouser/CSC120-A6) with the expanded version contained in this repo, and make sure that your implementations of `House.java`, `Library.java`, and `Cafe.java` still work as expected.

## Phase 1: Overriding Methods
The `Building` class provides a lot of useful functionality, but some of it doesn't quite work for all three of our `Building` subclasses. This isn't a problem: we'll just **override** them!  _Hint: use `super` whenever possible to avoid duplicating code!_

### `showOptions()`
Since each of the three subclasses have additional options, start by overriding the `showOptions()` method to reflect the subclass-specific options for `House`, `Library`, and `Cafe`.

### `goToFloor(int n)`
Most `Library` buildings (and some `House`s as well) have elevators, which means it is possible to move between non-adjacent floors in a single action. Override the `goToFloor(int n)` method to reflect this. _Hint: you may want to add a `boolean` attribute to elevator-friendly classes to indicate whether or not the building has an elevator, and use this in determining whether or not a call to `goToFloor(...)` is valid._


## Phase 2: Overloading Methods
As we see in the `Building` class, it can often be handy to have multiple versions of a method to handle different types/numbers of input. For this phase, implement **at least 2** overloaded methods for each of the subclasses. You may choose to overload only the constructors, or any other methods of your choosing. Please document which methods you overloaded (and why!) in your `reflection.md`.

## Phase 3: `CampusMap.java`
We'll use the `CampusMap` class to **aggregate** many different `Building`s together:

Expanding on the example in `CampusMap.main(...)`, add at least 10 more of your favorite Smith College buildings.

## Kudos (OPTIONAL)
Want to test your programming chops out on a stretch goal that will help prepare you for your final project? See if you can make your map **interactive** by implementing a `loop` that enables the user to explore various buildings and make use of their various methods (e.g. moving into a `House`, checking out a book at the `Library` or buying a cup of coffee at the `Cafe`).
