- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


Inheritance allows us to share properties between classes, meaning fewer characters for us to write and less data for the computer to process. For me, it is a bit annoying to have to remember what information parent classes are looking for, but VSCode and the extensions help a lot. 

The major issue I had with completing this assignment was that my computer deleted both git and homebrew. I suggest that computers not do that. I also recommend getting help with fixing that issue as soon as possible in order to move on with actual coding.
